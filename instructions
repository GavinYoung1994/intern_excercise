The files dataset_a.csv and dataset_b.csv contain two months worth of bank account interactions for two bank customers stored as CSV files.  Both customers have a Savings account, a Checking account, and a Credit account, with multiple positive and negative interactions with the amount of money in each.  You may assume that, prior to October 10, 2015, all of these accounts had a $0 balance.

Using this data, write a program that will allow a user to specify a month and account type, and receive ending balance totals for each account of that type.

For example, if the user enters:
OCTOBER SAVINGS

An acceptable output might be:

October Savings Ending Balance:
AccountHolder001 $100.00
AccountHolder002 $25.67

Specifications:
* Your program should accept some form of user input.
* This program should pull its data from a MySQL database using data supplied in the CSV files as an external data source populating that database. It should not pull data directly from the CSV files.
* The output must return the month and account type specified and the ending balances that match the query, listing the separate account totals in a meaningful way, such as the method illustrated above.
* Use the programming language of your choice to write this program.  It must be able to interact with a MySQL database.
* Retain all information from the CSV files that is relevant to the program's requirements.
* Feel free to address any ambiguities in specification by making (and documenting) assumptions.

Deliverables:
* Your program code, along with instructions for how to run it, and how to perform queries using it.
* A data dump of all data from the MySQL database.
